## solar-system-animation
Interactive animation of a solar system. Contains a sun and planets that revolve around it while rotating around their axis. The point of view is controlled by the four arrow keys. 
Used OpenGL primitives for the shape of the sun and loaded a 3D model for the shape of the planets.
